The solution for creating the front-end project comes from [this](udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) course.

<br> This is the beginning of a project to design a website. Herein you will find HTML code of my shortened CV with some additional things after couple hours into the course. Preview can be found [here](https://aurimas13.github.io/front-end-web/) </br>
